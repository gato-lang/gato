    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Gato <small>&mdash; We all deserve good software. And cake. And cats.</small></h1>
    <p>Gato is a general-purpose programming language.</p>
    <p>Right now it's still vaporware, but I've been thinking about it for years and I finally started writing a compiler for it in the last days of 2023, so I've settled on a name and reserved some domains.</p>
    <p>Gato's design prioritizes correctness, efficiency, and productivity.</p>
    <p><strong>Correctness</strong> meaning that Gato is designed to be better than previous languages at avoiding and mitigating bugs.</p>
    <p><strong>Efficiency</strong> meaning that Gato should facilitate writing software which uses the computing power and memory of the machine it runs on as efficiently as possible. This has multiple implications, including the need to have good support for concurrency and parallelism.</p>
    <p><strong>Productivity</strong> meaning that reading and writing Gato code should be a piece of cake. ðŸ¤£ Puns aside, this goal is inseparable from the previous two, as it's about facilitating the creation and maintenance of correct and efficient software. Readability is partly subjective, but Python is widely considered to have good code readability, and Gato's syntax is inspired by Python's.</p>
    <p>While Rust is advertised as having almost identical qualities, it doesn't have them to the maximum extent possible, because it wasn't designed to. Basically, Rust was an attempt to improve upon C(++), and it did, but Gato aims to be significantly better than Rust (and Python) for as many use cases as possible.</p>
